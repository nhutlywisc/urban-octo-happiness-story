Once upon a time, there is a V boy tries to go up the stair case.
Unfortunately, he falls down.
Then he tries again.
He falls again.
"Wow, amazing poem, Jamal," Mrs. Tentacles announced. Jamal took his seat,
looking quite forlorn. The rest of the school day was excruciatingly tiring. Especially,
for our 8 armed friend Jamal. You see, Jamal just recently moved to the eastern side of the 
reef and he was having a tough time making friends at his new school. He didn't like doing many things either,
besides playing his french horn. 
It didn'thave to wait too long anymore. The next ay was going to bring him new joy. The next day Jamal went he noticed his classroom was empty. Was it a holiday today? No, infact the entire class had prepared a surprise for him!!!
What was the surprise? All of his great classmates wrote poems in the same style as Jamal! One was about falling down a ladder, one was about
falling down a well, one was about falling down a slide and so on. Jamal was so happy that his classmates were that 
thoughtul, and the rest of the day was great.
