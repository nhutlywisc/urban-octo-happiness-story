Once upon a time, there is a V boy tries to go up the stair case.
Unfortunately, he falls down.
Then he tries again.
He falls again.
"Wow, amazing poem, Jamal," Mrs. Tentacles announced. Jamal took his seat,
looking quite forlorn. The rest of the school day was excruciatingly tiring. Especially,
for our 8 armed friend Jamal. You see, Jamal just recently moved to the eastern side of the 
reef and he was having a tough time making friends at his new school. He didn't like doing many things either,
besides playing his french horn.
